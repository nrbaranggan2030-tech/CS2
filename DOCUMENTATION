## 4. Methodology

### How Core Features Were Implemented

#### Expense Storage
Expenses are stored in a *list of dictionaries*:
```python
expense = {"date": date, "category": category, "amount": amount}

Summary Calculations

Dictionaries store totals:

daily_summary

weekly_summary

monthly_summary


This allows fast updates and easy retrieval.

5. Technologies Used (with Justification)

Technology	Reason

Python	Beginner-friendly and readable
datetime library	Tracks dates for summaries
Dictionaries	Efficient for storing totals
Lists	Simple expense storage



---
6. Key Design Decisions & Trade-offs

Decision	Reason

Console-based UI	Simpler for beginner level
Local data storage only	No need for internet/database
Dictionaries for summaries	Faster computation


Trade-off:

No graphical interface yet (future improvement).

7. Backend–Frontend Communication

Not applicable.
This is a standalone console application.
